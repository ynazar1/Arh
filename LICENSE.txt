Original parts of Arh addon Rights are Reserved by their respective authors
With the original authors not responding to requests and seemingly inactive, this puts the licensing into a limbo

This is for personal,non-commerical, and free use only.  

Updated Parts are under MIT licence as I need to add a license here

Sounds/Graphics are under fair use from Blizzard assets.

TL;DR: Don't copy this without giving credit
